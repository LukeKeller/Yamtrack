"""Fork-version release notes surfaced through the What's New modal.

This file is the source of truth for the fork's version identifier and for the
per-version changelog rendered on first load after each YunoHost upgrade. The
modal compares ``request.user.last_seen_version`` against ``CURRENT_FORK_VERSION``
and shows every entry newer than what the user has dismissed.

Bump ``CURRENT_FORK_VERSION`` whenever a new ``Bump fork package`` marker lands
on ``dev`` and prepend a matching entry to ``RELEASE_NOTES`` (newest first).
